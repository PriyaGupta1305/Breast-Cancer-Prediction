This breast cancer detection project is designed to leverage machine learning algorithms for the early identification of breast cancer.
Utilizing the  Breast Cancer Dataset , the model aims to classify tumors as either malignant or benign based on various biopsy features.
The project is structured into key phases, beginning with data exploration and preprocessing. 
This involves understanding the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
Feature selection follows, where the importance of each feature is analyzed, and relevant ones are chosen for model training. 
The next step involves selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm, such as LogisticRegression, Random Forest, DecisionTreeClassifier and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
